## About the game
In this game, you are invited to guess 10 prime number between 2000 to 7000.
If you guess 5+ number correctly, you win.

I am not currently sharing the source code, so that you can build the game by your own. Maybe later I will share the source code. 

Meanwhile if you found any `bug` kindly inform me.

Thanks for playing the game.
